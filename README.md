##Description:

Creating keymaps is a complex task. This tool was created because I wanted to use
a Colemak layout on my Amiga machines, which I could find anywhere.
Looking at existing methods to create keymaps, I decided to create a new keymap
editor in order to learn and understand keymap design and Amiga operating concepts.
Fatma is also an exercise in creating an effective user interface for a fairly
complicated task.

## Note for people who want to use the colemak1 keymap

Since github removed the file uploads feature, I put the colemak1 keymap in the
source, under src/main/resources/keymaps.

To use it, copy said file into your DEVS:keymaps folder on your Amiga system.
